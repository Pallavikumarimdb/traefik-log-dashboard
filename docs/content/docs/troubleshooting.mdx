## Configuration

### Environment Agent vs. Manual Agents

One of the most important concepts to understand in Traefik Log Dashboard is the distinction between the **Environment Agent** and **Manual Agents**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **At least one agent must be configured via environment variables.**
>
> When you deploy the dashboard using `docker-compose.yml`, the agent configured via `AGENT_API_URL` and `AGENT_API_TOKEN` becomes the **Environment Agent**.
>
> - This agent **cannot** be modified or deleted from the Dashboard UI.
> - If you remove these environment variables, the dashboard will revert to default values or fail to connect.
> - This is by design to ensure there is always a "source of truth" agent that persists across container recreations.

To add more agents that you *can* manage entirely from the UI:
1. Keep your primary agent defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Use the **Settings > Agents** page in the dashboard to add secondary agents. These "Manual Agents" are stored in the SQLite database and can be edited/deleted freely.

## Common Issues

### Is it possible to connect remote agents without exposing port 5000?

**No, not currently.**

The dashboard architecture relies on direct HTTP communication with the agent's API.
- The dashboard (running in your browser or Next.js server) needs to send HTTP requests to the Agent.
- The Agent must expose its API port (default `5000`) to be reachable by the Dashboard.

If security is a concern, we recommend:
1. **VPN/Tunneling**: Use a VPN (like Tailscale or WireGuard) to connect the Dashboard and Agent securely without exposing ports to the public internet.
2. **Reverse Proxy**: Put the Agent behind a reverse proxy (like Traefik itself) with Basic Auth or IP allow-listing, and configure the Dashboard to use that proxied URL.

### Dashboard Feature Requests & Planned Improvements

We are actively working on improving the UI and UX. Some frequently requested features include:

#### 1. Filter Logs by Clicking
**Request:** Allow filtering logs by simply clicking on headers (e.g., clicking a status code `500` filters for all errors).
**Status:** Planned. We are looking into adding interactive headers to the log table for quicker filtering.

#### 2. Enhanced GeoIP Integration
**Request:** Better integration between the Interactive Map and log filters (e.g., clicking a country on the map filters logs).
**Status:** Under consideration for future releases.
