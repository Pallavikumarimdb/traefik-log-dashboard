## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard at `/dashboard` displays real-time analytics from your connected Traefik agent.

### Overview Cards

- **Total Requests**: Aggregate count of all HTTP requests processed
- **Average Response Time**: Mean response time across all requests (in milliseconds)
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of requests with 4xx or 5xx status codes
- **Active Services**: Number of unique Traefik services handling traffic

### Geographic Cards

- **Interactive Globe**: 3D visualization of request origins with zoom and rotation
- **Geographic Map**: 2D heatmap view with smooth transitions from globe
- **Top Countries**: Requests grouped by country
- **Top Cities**: Requests grouped by city

### Traffic Analysis

- **Status Code Distribution**: Breakdown of 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx responses
- **Top Services**: Most active Traefik services by request count
- **Top Routers**: Most active Traefik routers by request count
- **HTTP Methods**: Distribution of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

### Performance Metrics

- **Response Time Chart**: Time-series graph of response times
- **Request Rate**: Requests per second/minute/hour
- **Slowest Endpoints**: Top routes by average response time
- **Error Timeline**: Time-series of error occurrences

## Filtering Logs

The filter toolbar at the top of the dashboard provides:

- **Time Range**: Last 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d, or custom range
- **Status Codes**: Filter by 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
- **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
- **Services**: Filter by Traefik service name
- **Routers**: Filter by Traefik router name
- **Search**: Free-text search across all fields

### Advanced Filters

Navigate to **Settings > Filters** to create custom filter rules:

- **Include Mode**: Show ONLY logs matching your criteria
- **Exclude Mode**: Hide logs matching your criteria
- **Operators**: equals, contains, starts with, ends with, regex
- **Geographic**: Filter by country or city

## Managing Agents

Navigate to **Settings > Agents** to manage your Traefik agent connections.

### Adding Agents

1. Click **Add Agent**
2. Enter the agent name, URL, and authentication token
3. Select location type (on-site or off-site)
4. Click **Save**

### Environment Agent

<Callout type="warn">
The agent configured via environment variables (`AGENT_API_URL`, `AGENT_API_TOKEN`) cannot be deleted from the UI. This ensures you always have a primary agent connection.
</Callout>

## Setting Up Alerts

Navigate to **Settings > Alerts** to configure notifications.

### Webhook Setup

1. Click the **Webhooks** tab
2. Add your Discord or generic webhook URL
3. Test the webhook to verify connectivity

### Alert Rules

Create alert rules with:
- **Threshold Alerts**: Trigger when metrics exceed limits
- **Interval Alerts**: Scheduled summaries (hourly, daily)
- **Custom Parameters**: Request count, error rate, response time, top IPs, etc.

## Agent API Usage

All API endpoints require Bearer token authentication.

### Get Access Logs

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:5000/api/logs/access?lines=100"
```

### Get Agent Status

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:5000/api/logs/status"
```

### Get System Resources

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:5000/api/system/resources"
```

## Demo Mode

Access `/dashboard/demo` to explore the dashboard with simulated data. No agent connection required.

Demo mode generates realistic traffic patterns including:
- Geographic distribution across multiple countries
- Various status codes and response times
- Multiple services and routers
- Simulated error scenarios
