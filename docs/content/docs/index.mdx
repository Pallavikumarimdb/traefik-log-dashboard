# Traefik Log Dashboard

A comprehensive analytics platform for Traefik access logs with three deployment options: a Go-based API agent, a modern Next.js web dashboard, and a beautiful terminal-based CLI.

## Overview

Traefik Log Dashboard provides real-time insights into your Traefik reverse proxy traffic. It consists of three components:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Agent
Go-based backend API that parses logs and exposes metrics with high performance and low resource usage.
</Step>

<Step>
### Dashboard
Next.js 15 web UI with interactive charts, real-time updates, and beautiful visualizations including 3D globe and geographic maps. Includes automatic GeoIP lookup.
</Step>

<Step>
### CLI (Optional)
Beautiful terminal-based dashboard for monitoring directly from your command line.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Core Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture** - Manage multiple Traefik instances from a single dashboard
- **Interactive Globe Visualization** - 3D globe with smooth transitions to geographic maps
- **Automatic GeoIP** - IP geolocation works out of the box
- **Advanced Filtering** - Include/exclude modes, country/city filtering, custom conditions
- **Background Alerting** - Discord webhooks, daily summaries, threshold alerts
- **Persistent Agent Database** - SQLite-based storage for agent configurations
- **High Performance** - Optimized log parsing, parallel fetching, lazy loading

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent Architecture

The platform supports a **multi-agent architecture** where you can deploy multiple agent instances across different Traefik installations and aggregate their data through a single dashboard.

        Agent1[Agent #1]
        Traefik1[Traefik Logs]
        Agent1 --> Traefik1
    end

    subgraph "Agent 2 (Cloud)"
        Agent2[Agent #2]
        Traefik2[Traefik Logs]
        Agent2 --> Traefik2
    end

    subgraph "Agent 3 (Edge)"
        Agent3[Agent #3]
        Traefik3[Traefik Logs]
        Agent3 --> Traefik3
    end

```

### Key Architectural Components

1. **Dashboard** - Centralized web UI that communicates with multiple agents
2. **Agents** - Deployed alongside each Traefik instance to parse local logs
3. **SQLite Database** - Stores agent configurations, status, and metadata
4. **Token Authentication** - Secures communication between dashboard and agents
