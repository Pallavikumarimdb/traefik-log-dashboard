## v2.4.0 (2026-01)

### Bug Fixes

- **Dark Mode**: Fixed various dark mode styling issues across components
- **Sidebar**: Improved navigation and renamed menu items for clarity
- **Interactive Map**: Fixed D3.js map rendering and geolocation display issues
- **UI Polish**: Various bug fixes for cards, charts, and dashboard layout

### Improvements

## v2.3.0 (2025-12-30)

### Architecture Changes

- **GeoIP moved to Dashboard**: Geographic IP lookup now handled entirely by the dashboard using `geolite2-redist` npm package. No configuration required - databases are auto-downloaded.
- **Agent simplified**: Removed GeoIP configuration from agent. Agent now focuses solely on log parsing and system monitoring.

### Performance Improvements

- **Dashboard rendering**: Added React.memo to card components (StatCard, TopRoutesCard, BackendsCard, TimelineCard, StatusCodeDistributionCard, TopServicesCard, RoutersCard)
- **Dynamic imports**: Heavy components (TimelineCard, StatusCodeDistributionCard, UserAgentsCard, RecentLogsTable, InteractiveGeoMap) now lazy-loaded with skeleton states
- **Bundle size reduced**: Dashboard First Load JS reduced from 301 kB to 168 kB (44% reduction)
- **Agent log parsing**: Fixed O(n^2) tail operation, replaced with O(n) reverse-then-flip approach
- **Agent sorting**: Replaced bubble sort with sort.Strings (O(n log n))
- **Agent memory**: Added slice pre-allocation throughout log parsing code
- **Metrics deduplication**: Fixed timestamp causing redundant API calls

### Documentation

- Updated all documentation to reflect GeoIP architecture change
- Removed outdated GeoIP configuration from agent docs
- Simplified quickstart guide
- Cleaned up redundant files (REFACTORING_*.md, docs/archive/*)

### Breaking Changes

- Agent no longer supports GeoIP environment variables (`TRAEFIK_LOG_DASHBOARD_GEOIP_*`)
- GeoIP volume mount no longer needed on agent containers
